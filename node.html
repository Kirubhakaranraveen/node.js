    <h1>Node.js</h1>
    <h2>
        Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
        You need to recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language.
         It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.

    <ul>
        <li><h3>Any javascript application can be run only on browser,because to execute js node we need
            JS engine that is present only in browser like Chrome has v8,Explore has Chakra.</h3>
        </li>
        <li><h3>But Ryan Dahl,wrote some code using C C++,javascript and executed it using v8 engine,this code is now 
            commonly known as Node js,this allow us to execute the js code outside the browser.</h3>
